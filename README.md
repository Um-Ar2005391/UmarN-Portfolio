### Projects

#### Inventory Management and Loan Calculation

This project involved building upon Excel sheets with tools like VLOOKUP and PMT functions to create a comprehensive inventory management system and view options for loan financing.

***Initial project idea:***  
 
This project was built upon the work of assessments 5, 6, and 7; in these projects I constructed an Inventory Manager with conditional formatting and equations. For this project I needed to create a separate sheet to use the v-lookup function and create another table to analyze potential financing options.   

***Tools I used:***

Two Excel tools were primarily used for this project, the VLOOKUP function and the PMT function for loan calculations. I also used various functions of Excel, like dragging equations, conditional formatting, text wrapping, and sum equations to give more detailed information regarding loan amounts.   

***Challenges I faced:***

The main challenge of this project was organization; due to the number of entries, and the different variables associated with each type of interest, it was difficult to keep track of everything or fix mistakes I may have made. To get over this hurdle, I organized the data and categories before making major equations or formatting changes. 

***Other Resources:*** 

To better understand the VLOOKUP function, I watched some guides on Excel online and practiced using class materials. 

***Result:*** 

I set out to create a comprehensive financial analysis tool within my inventory management system and make the inventory management system more efficient. I achieved this by integrating VLOOKUP and PMT functions, along with the other various equations that I integrated in the past, which provided a clearer overview of pricing and loan options.

#### Python Personality Quiz

The Personality Test project involved coding an interactive quiz, using while loops, if statements, and error checking, to give personality results based on user inputs; it acted as a test for coding ability and creativity.

***Initial project idea:***  

This project aimed to code a test that could tell someone their personality type depending on the questions they answered. It was meant to be a way to practice print statements, conditionals, while loops, and error checking within Python; we had previously completed projects that focused on one or more of these tools, but this project pushed us to use every tool we had learned.  

***Tools I used:*** 

The tools used in Python included print statements, while loops, break or continue commands, if-elif-else statements, typecasting, capitalizing, digit checking, and variables. 

***Challenges I faced:***

My main challenge with this project was creating error checking methods that would catch different types of errors at different parts. In the original code, I attempted to use the first check would see if the input was a digit, then pass to if it was a viable character. If a number was input the second time around, it would break. I corrected this issue by creating a while loop that would continuously run until all checks were passed; by using a key variable to keep the loop going until that key was changed, the error checking was more rigorous and less likely to fail. 

***Other Resources:***  

I primarily used class materials to complete this project, although I did use guides to help streamline certain areas of code, such as recognizing the range of viable letters for user input.  

***Result:***

I did manage to code a working personality test with proper error checking and display of results; however, I would’ve liked to reduce the lines of code that I used. Most of the code is the same, with only variables and question text swapped.

#### Student Transcripts in Microsoft Access

The Microsoft Access project involved creating student and grade tables, a relationship, and queries for the tables that allowed me to create a pair of student transcripts separated into semesters and display GPAs.

***Initial project idea:***  

The goal of this project was to create a table of students, a table of 50 different classes with grades, and a pair of student transcripts using Microsoft Access.  

***Tools I used:***  

The tools used included various applications of MS Access, such as table creation, primary keys, relationship between tables, queries about the tables, and the report wizard tool.  

***Challenges I faced:*** 

The main issue that came up during the process was organizing the data for the grades and classes. The semester column caused issues as I would add more classes to a semester than necessary, or I would forget to add some. I resolved this by redoing the column once I had already created the rest of the records needed. 

***Other Resources:***  

I used Apporto, a virtual machine, to use MS Access and its full suite of features. Otherwise, the only resources I used were provided by the class.  

***Result:***

I was able to create a pair of transcripts that showed different semesters and their respective GPAs, as well as an overall GPA. But an issue I would’ve resolved would be the formatting of the G in the grades column on the transcript, the G is cut off and I was unable to resolve that issue using Access.
